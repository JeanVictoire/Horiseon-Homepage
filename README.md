# Horiseon Homepage Accessibility Refactor

Horiseon Homepage : Refactoring the style.css and the index.html with proper semantic.

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

I made sure to add an "Alt" to all the image
I made sur to use proper semantic and also I made sure to comment the code so it will be easy to read.
I also made the code smaller by removing element that repeat itself.

I Made sure all the link function properlly.
